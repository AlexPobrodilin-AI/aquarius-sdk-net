## AQUARIUS.SDK.Legacy

This NuGet package is only required when you need to write a program that supports older API versions in addition to the current version.

You'll find yourself here only if a product has introduced a breaking API change, which we hope is a very rare occurrence. If it's happended to you, we're sorry. :)
